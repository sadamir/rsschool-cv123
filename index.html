  <h2>About yourself:</h2>
  <p>Currently I’m working as a Supervisor Air Traffic Controller.
    Throughout my career in aviation industry which is currently almost 8 years,
    I’ve been thinking about returning into an IT industry,
    because I’ve graduated IT univeristy in 2012, but due to personal issues
    I had to switch my career path in 2013. Now is the time to get back to basics.
    I believe that I will become Front-End Developer in 2022.
