#### About myself:
Currently I'm working as a Supervisor Air Traffic Controller. Throughout my career in aviation industry which is currently almost 8 years, I've been thinking about returning into an IT industry, because I've graduated IT univeristy in 2012, but due to personal issues I had to switch my career path in 2013. Now is the time to get back to basics. I believe that I will become Front-End Developer in 2022.

#### Skills:
One of my biggest skills is that I always believe in myself. I know that, I'm not a quiter once I start something in my life. Throughout my career in aviation industry as a person who is responsible for the safety of flights in the air, I've developed the most important professional skill which is BEING ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE for your own actions. I believe that this personal trait will be vital during my career in an IT industry.
