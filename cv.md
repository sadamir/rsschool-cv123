Throughout my career in aviation industry which is currently almost 8 years, I've been thinking about returning into an IT industry, because I've graduated IT univeristy in 2012, but due to personal issues I had to switch my career path in 2013. Now is the time to get back to basics. I believe that I will become Front-End Developer in 2022.
